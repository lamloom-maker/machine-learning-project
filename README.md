# Machine Learning Application for House Price Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices using socioeconomic and housing-related features.
The objective is to build robust predictive models that support data-driven decision-making for investors, analysts, and policymakers.

## Problem Statement
Accurately predicting house prices is challenging due to the complex interactions between location, demographics, and economic factors.
This project investigates multiple machine learning models to capture these relationships and improve prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset includes housing-related attributes such as:
- Median income
- Housing age
- Population density
- Geographic indicators
- Housing value metrics

## Methods & Models
The following approaches were implemented:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Regression (LR)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Hierarchical Clustering (HC)

## Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Prediction accuracy
- Error-based metrics
- Comparative performance analysis across models

Results indicate that ensemble-based models, particularly Random Forest, achieved superior predictive performance compared to traditional methods.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Contribution
This project was developed collaboratively.

My contributions include:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model development, training, and tuning
- Performance evaluation and result interpretation
- Visualization and comparative analysis of model outputs

## Notes
An academic report related to this project is included in the `docs/` directory for reference purposes only.
The primary focus of this repository is the practical implementation and experimentation.
